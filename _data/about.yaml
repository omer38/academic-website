# about me
first-paragraph: I am a research assistant at the <hightlight>Learning and Adaptive Robotics (LEARN) Lab</hightlight> affiliated with the <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Arlington</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=huber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Manfred Huber</a>, building upon the research I initiated during my undergraduate studies here.
