    abstract-less: IN this project, we propose the novel architecture Sliding Window Attention-GAN (SWaTGAN), which utilizes the sliding window attention (SWA), proposed in TransGAN. 
    abstract-more: SWA limits the receptive field of each token to a pre-determined window size. In this way, in the early layers of transformer blocks, the similarity score is calculated between the near-by tokens. The receptive field of each token increases towards the latter transformer layers, enabling the model to capture long-range  dependencies despite starting with a narrow receptive field.
